# Xolotls Weird Delay

Early in it's development, Xolotl had a screwy little, 16 stage delay effect that got axed for being a CPU hog and generally sounding odd. 

Xolotls Weird Delay is an extended version of that delay. It features:

- 3 freely assignable FX slots
- Delay, Granular, Pitch shift and filter FX
- 16 Stages for multiple paramters 
- 5 complex modulators
- 2 envelope followers
